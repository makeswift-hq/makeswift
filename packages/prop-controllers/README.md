# @makeswift/prop-controllers

This package contains deprecated prop-controllers and is intended for internal use only.

The Makeswift Builder and API rely on the prop-controllers to access the type information necessary for writing and introspecting the element tree. However, these prop-controllers are deprecated and should not be used directly by users.

In the future, a separate package called `@makeswift/controls` will be added to provide the controls intended for use by users.
