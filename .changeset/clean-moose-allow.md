"makeswift": patch
---

Add a `link` command.

The `link` command will allow users with an existing Next.js site to link it to a Makeswift site. This command does nothing in terms of setting up Makeswift pages or using the client inside the Next.js site - that part is expected to already be done upon use of this command.
