Add data type to `Slot`.

Upgrade notice: If you are using the `Slot` control in your application, please note that once you upgrade to this version, you will not be able to downgrade to a previous version. The previous version of the Slot control is not compatible with the new versioned data type and will not be able to properly render the control with the updated data structure.
